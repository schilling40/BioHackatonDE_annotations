# Collection of relevant features in OpenLayers

This should be an overview over relevant features in [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) which could be included in [OMERO iviewer](https://github.com/ome/omero-iviewer) to visualize labels and images.
The snippets are gathered from the examples supplied by OpenLayers: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/

## Layer Opacity

Adjust the opacity of a label layer. [Example](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/layer-opacity.html)

## Layer z-Index

Order layers in z-direction by supplying z-order. This is not optimal because a more intuitive implementation would most likely be a drag and drop principle but it could work as a first implementation. [Example](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/layer-z-index.html)

## Color Manipulation

This could be helpful for coloring different labels. [Example](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/color-manipulation.html)
